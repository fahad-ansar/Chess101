	- Protect the king at all cost
	- Say checkmate when any king is about to die in the game
	- when two pawns are infront they can do anything except they can kill anyone diagonally
	- when a pawn reaches in kings row it can revive a peice on its place.That would be apart of 
	  who died or who is one the board which means you have doubles of any peices other than king.
	- Checkamte : At edge of deing 
	- Stalemate : when there is no check mate but cant move his peice. The game.
	- Draw : If game is stuck in forever loop on mutual descion we end the game.
